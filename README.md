# batchtools

[![JOSS Publicatoin](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00135/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00135)
[![CRAN Status Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/batchtools)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=batchtools)

As a successor of the packages [BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs) and [BatchExperiments](https://github.com/tudo-r/Batchexperiments), batchtools provides a parallel implementation of Map for high performance computing systems managed by schedulers like Slurm, Sun Grid Engine, OpenLava, TORQUE/OpenPBS, Load Sharing Facility (LSF) or Docker Swarm (see the setup section in the [vignette](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/articles/batchtools.html)).

Main features:
* Convenience: All relevant batch system operations (submitting, listing, killing) are either handled internally or abstracted via simple R functions
* Portability: With a well-defined interface, the source is independent from the underlying batch system - prototype locally, deploy on any high performance cluster
* Reproducibility: Every computational part has an associated seed stored in a data base which ensures reproducibility even when the underlying batch system changes
* Abstraction: The code layers for algorithms, experiment definitions and execution are cleanly separated and allow to write readable and maintainable code to manage large scale computer experiments


## Installation
Install the stable version from CRAN:
```{R}
install.packages("batchtools")
```
For the development version, use [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):
```{R}
devtools::install_github("mllg/batchtools")
```

Next, you need to setup `batchtools` for your HPC (it will run sequentially otherwise).
See the [vignette](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/articles/batchtools.html#setup) for instructions.

## Why batchtools?
The development of [BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs/) and [BatchExperiments](https://github.com/tudo-r/Batchexperiments) is discontinued for the following reasons:

* Maintainability: The packages [BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs/) and [BatchExperiments](https://github.com/tudo-r/Batchexperiments) are tightly connected which makes maintenance difficult. Changes have to be synchronized and tested against the current CRAN versions for compatibility. Furthermore, BatchExperiments violates CRAN policies by calling internal functions of BatchJobs.
* Data base issues: Although we invested weeks to mitigate issues with locks of the SQLite data base or file system (staged queries, file system timeouts, ...), `BatchJobs` kept working unreliable on some systems with high latency under certain conditions. This made `BatchJobs` unusable for many users.

[BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs/) and [BatchExperiments](https://github.com/tudo-r/Batchexperiments) will remain on CRAN, but new features are unlikely to be ported back.
The [vignette](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/articles/batchtools.html#migration) contains a section comparing the packages.

## Contribution: custom read and write function for results
Use cases: saving results as hdf5, as loom, csv, txt, tsv, mtx, bam, etc

These use cases are usually paired with an R interface for the opening of such files.

### Plan:
Write a new method **writeCustom** that accepts a write function, **write_fun**. Also create a corresponding **readCustom** that accepts a read function, **read_fun**.

#### Replace **writeRDS** with **writeCustom**
```
doJobCollection.R
164:      writeRDS(result, file = getResultFiles(jc, id), compress = jc$compress)
```
```
Job.R

93:        writeRDS(result, file = cache.file, compress = self$compress)
```

#### Replace **readRDS** with **readCustom**
```
testJob.R
51:      return(readRDS(fn.res))
```
```
loadResult.R
17:  return(readRDS(fn))
```
```
Job.R
84:          result = try(readRDS(cache.file))
```
```
reduceResults.R
84:    init = readRDS(fns[1L])
93:      init = fun(init, readRDS(fns[i]), job = makeJob(ids[i], reg = reg), ...)
98:      init = fun(init, readRDS(fns[i]), ...)
228:      res = worker(readRDS(fns[i]), makeJob(ids$job.id[i], reader = reader, reg = reg), ...)
```
